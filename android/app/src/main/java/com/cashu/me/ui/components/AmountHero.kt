/**
 * The gap between the numerals and a unit word, as a fraction of the value's

 * character, so the gap is an exact measurement instead of whatever advance the
 * face happens to give a space — which differs between families and would
 * silently retune itself on a font swap.

 * A currency *symbol* is not a unit *word* and does not want the same handling.
 * `sat` is a label and recedes; the `$` in `$18.42` is part of reading the

 * keeps full ink and weight, drops only slightly in size, and tucks tight.

/**
 * The one hero numeral.
 *
 * Owns the value/unit lockup, tabular figures, the line box and the autoscale
 * floor, so that no caller can get any of them individually wrong — which is
 * how the same amount ended up rendering at six different sizes in two
 * different typefaces before this existed.
 *
 * **One `Text`, two styled runs, deliberately.** An outer `Row` of two `Text`s
 * would let [TextAutoSize] shrink the value and the unit independently, so the
 * size relationship between them would drift exactly when it matters most — on
 * the long amounts that trigger scaling. Runs inside one string scale together.
 *
 * The reserved height is derived from the resolved line box rather than being a
 * constant: stable within a text size, so a unit swap or a fiat show/hide can
 * never reflow the home canvas, but growing with the text size, so large-text
 * users are not cropped. That pair of properties is the whole reason the old
 * fixed `62.dp` had to go.
