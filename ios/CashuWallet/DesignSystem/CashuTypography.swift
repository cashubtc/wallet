/// face here, and the reason is worth recording: SF Symbols are drawn to SF
/// Pro's cap height and weight axis, so pairing them with any other family
/// desynchronises icon-and-label alignment on every `Label`, every settings
/// row, and the tab bar. On top of that, alerts, action sheets, the share sheet
/// and the keyboard render in SF Pro no matter what the app asks for, so a
/// bundled body face would leave the app permanently mixed-face.
///
/// The indirection exists anyway, because a family owns more than a name: it
/// owns the cap-height metric the amount lockup aligns against and the per-role
/// tracking table. Both are properties of the face, not of the role.
