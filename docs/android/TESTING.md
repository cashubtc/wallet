# Android Testing

The Android test stack drives the production `MainActivity` and production
Compose navigation. It combines deterministic in-process wallet fixtures for
user journeys with a narrow real-CDK boundary against local test mints. Tests
must never contact public mints, relays, telemetry, or real financial
infrastructure.

## Test layers

- `src/test`: JVM unit and integration tests.
- `src/androidTest`: component, accessibility, navigation, and production-app
  emulator journeys.
- `src/screenshotTest`: ten deterministic Compose Preview screenshot baselines.
- `macrobenchmark`: release-validation performance coverage; it is separate
  from behavioral correctness.

The required journey suite mirrors the iOS smoke flows and adds mint lifecycle,
send/receive ecash, Lightning receive and invoice-payment transitions, history,
settings persistence, deep links, validation, failure, retry, camera-permission
UX, and destructive-action confirmation.
`LiveLocalMintMainActivityJourneyTest` adds a real-CDK UI boundary against
Nutshell. Tests annotated `FullOnly` run only in nightly and release tiers;
tests annotated `Compatibility` form the small cross-device behavior pack.

The [wallet UI coverage matrix](../testing/wallet-ui-coverage.md) lists the
priority interactions, including currency units, restore, app lock, advanced
settings, and recovery. The [bug report](../testing/ui-coverage-report.md) records
defects found while adding these journeys and their validation results.

## Deterministic app runtime

`CashuUiTestRunner` launches the debug-only `UiTestApplication`. The application
does not create an app container until `AppTestFixture` installs one, so no
activity or production service can race fixture setup.

`UiRuntimePolicy.DeterministicTest` disables telemetry, public relay listeners,
startup maintenance, NWC startup, foreground quote polling, and automatic
clipboard reads. Explicit UI actions still call either `FakeWalletGateway` or
the real CDK gateway connected to a local mint. Cleartext HTTP is accepted only
in this policy and only for emulator/host loopback addresses; production still
requires HTTPS. The same policy drives the production scanner UI through a
deterministic denied/allow/ready permission contract while replacing only the
OS grant dialog and physical camera preview.

Available fixture modes are:

- `EmptyWallet`
- `SeededWithoutMint`
- `SeededWithMint`
- `FundedWithHistory`
- `LiveSeededWithoutMint`
- `LiveLocalMint`

The fake has fixed test-only seed, token, invoice, balance, quote, and
transaction data. Tests explicitly advance quote states such as invoice-paid;
there are no timer-based transitions. Android Test Orchestrator clears package
data and creates a fresh instrumentation process for every test.

Price, NPC transport, and authentication responses are injected through app
dependencies. Currency journeys use fixed exchange rates. The camera fixture
replaces capture while retaining production scanner controls and key shortcuts.
These fixtures exercise application behavior, not OS enrollment or real camera
recognition.

## Local commands

Use JDK 17 or newer and an installed Android SDK. Commands below start in the
repository root unless the snippet changes directory.

Compile the app and instrumentation suite:

```sh
cd android
./gradlew --no-daemon \
  :app:compileDebugKotlin \
  :app:compileDebugAndroidTestKotlin
```

Run JVM checks:

```sh
cd android
./gradlew --no-daemon :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:lintDebug
```

Run the required PR emulator suite. The local Nutshell URL is the Android
emulator's host-loopback address:

```sh
./CI/setup-nutshell.sh
./CI/start-nutshell.sh 3338
cd android
./gradlew --no-daemon :app:pixel2Api35DebugAndroidTest \
  -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.notAnnotation=com.cashu.me.test.FullOnly \
  -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.cashu.liveUiLocalMintEnabled=true \
  -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.cashu.nutshellMintUrl=http://10.0.2.2:3338
cd ..
./CI/stop-nutshell.sh
```

Run one deterministic journey class without a mint:

```sh
cd android
./gradlew --no-daemon :app:pixel2Api35DebugAndroidTest \
  -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.class=com.cashu.me.ui.journeys.MainActivityJourneyTest
```

Run the full local-mint tier:

```sh
./CI/setup-nutshell.sh
./CI/setup-cdk.sh 3339 android
./CI/start-nutshell.sh 3338
./CI/start-cdk.sh
cd android
./gradlew --no-daemon :app:modernApi36DebugAndroidTest \
  -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.cashu.liveUiLocalMintEnabled=true \
  -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.cashu.nativeWalletLocalMintIntegration=true \
  -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.cashu.nutshellMintUrl=http://10.0.2.2:3338 \
  -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.cashu.cdkMintUrl=http://10.0.2.2:3339
cd ..
./CI/stop-nutshell.sh
./CI/stop-cdk.sh
```

Run either compatibility device:

```sh
cd android
./gradlew --no-daemon :app:compactApi26DebugAndroidTest \
  -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.annotation=com.cashu.me.test.Compatibility
./gradlew --no-daemon :app:tabletApi35DebugAndroidTest \
  -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.annotation=com.cashu.me.test.Compatibility
```

## Screenshot baselines

Pixel comparison is limited to the deterministic host-side preview suite.
Full-app emulator screenshots are failure diagnostics, not golden images.

Validate committed references:

```sh
cd android
./gradlew --no-daemon :app:validateDebugScreenshotTest
```

Update references only after visually reviewing the intended UI change:

```sh
cd android
./gradlew --no-daemon :app:updateDebugScreenshotTest
```

References live in `app/src/screenshotTestDebug/reference`. CI validates them
but never updates or commits them.

## Authoring rules

- Launch production screens through `AppTestFixture`; do not substitute fake
  screen implementations.
- Prefer visible text and accessibility semantics. Use `UiTestTags` only for
  screen roots or controls whose semantics are otherwise ambiguous.
- Use `WalletJourneyRobot` condition waits. Never use fixed sleeps.
- Keep tests independent, English-locale, portrait-first, and deterministic.
- Use only fixed test data. Never paste a developer or user seed, token,
  invoice, URL, screenshot, or log into a fixture.
- Exercise deterministic camera, NFC, and biometric permission/unavailable
  contracts on the emulator; reserve Permission Controller integration and
  physical hardware behavior for release-device validation.
- Run automated accessibility checks on critical screens and preserve
  meaningful content descriptions and 48dp interaction targets.

On failure, `UiFailureArtifactsRule` stores a screenshot plus merged and
unmerged Compose semantics trees through AndroidX Test Storage. Managed-device
results also retain JUnit, HTML, logcat, and additional device output. CI
uploads these artifacts together with sanitized local-mint logs.

## CI tiers

`.github/workflows/android-ui-tests.yml` is reusable by release automation and
also runs directly:

- PR/push: Pixel 2, API 35 AOSP; required journeys excluding `FullOnly`, plus
  screenshot validation.
- Nightly at 03:00 UTC and release: full API 36 suite with local Nutshell and
  CDK mints.
- Nightly/release compatibility: API 26 compact phone and API 35 tablet ATD,
  filtered to `Compatibility`.

The release APK job depends on the reusable full UI workflow, so a failed
critical UI journey prevents Android artifact publication.
